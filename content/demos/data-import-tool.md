## Streamline Your Data Onboarding

Getting your data into our platform is crucial. Our Data Import Tool is designed to make this process as simple and efficient as possible.

### Supported Sources:

* **CSV Files:** Upload comma-separated value files directly. We automatically detect delimiters and headers in most cases.
* **Excel Spreadsheets:** Supports both `.xls` and `.xlsx` formats. Select the specific sheet to import.
* **Google Sheets:** Securely connect your Google account and select a sheet to import data from.
* **Direct Database Connection:** (Enterprise Plan) Connect directly to PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server databases.

### Key Features:

* **Field Mapping:** Easily map columns from your source file/database to the corresponding fields in our platform.
* **Data Validation:** The tool performs preliminary checks for common data errors (e.g., incorrect data types, missing required values) before importing.
* **Preview:** See a preview of how your data will look after import before committing the changes.
* **Error Reporting:** If issues occur during import, a detailed report is generated highlighting the problematic rows or fields.

This tool significantly reduces the manual effort required for data migration and helps ensure data integrity from the start.
