## Your Workspace in Your Pocket

We're excited to give you a sneak peek at our native mobile application, coming soon to iOS and Android! The app brings the core functionality of our platform to your fingertips.

Watch the video above for a walkthrough of the main screens and features.

### Planned Features:

* **Project Overview:** Quickly check the status of all your projects.
* **Task Management:** View, edit, and create tasks from anywhere.
* **Notifications:** Receive real-time updates on mentions and assignments.
* **Offline Access:** Limited offline capabilities for viewing key information (details TBC).
