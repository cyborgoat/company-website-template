## Hugging Face Transformers in Action

Transformers are the backbone of state-of-the-art NLP models. Hugging Face provides a wide range of pre-trained models for various tasks.

### Sentiment Analysis Demo

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
result = classifier("I love using Hugging Face Transformers!")
print(result)
```

### Text Summarization Demo

```python
from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
text = """
Transformers have transformed the way we process language. They enable better context understanding and improved results for many NLP tasks.
"""
summary = summarizer(text, max_length=30, min_length=10, do_sample=False)
print(summary[0]['summary_text'])
```
