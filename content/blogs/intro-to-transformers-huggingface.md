## What are Transformers?

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP). They excel at understanding context, making them ideal for tasks like translation, summarization, and text generation.

## Getting Started with Hugging Face

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) provides easy-to-use tools and pre-trained models for working with transformers in Python.

### Install Transformers Library

```bash
pip install transformers
```

### Simple Text Generation Demo

```python
from transformers import pipeline

generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")
result = generator("Once upon a time", max_length=30)
print(result[0]['generated_text'])
```

This code uses the GPT-2 model to generate text based on a prompt.

## Conclusion

Transformers and Hugging Face make it easy to build powerful NLP applications. Explore the [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/) for more features and models.
