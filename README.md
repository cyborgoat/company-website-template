# Company Website Template - Next.js

This is a template for building a modern company website using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). It includes features for managing content like blogs and news articles via Markdown files.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a foundation for a company or organizational website. It leverages modern web development practices and tools to provide a performant, stylable, and content-manageable website experience.

**Key Technologies:**

* **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (using the App Router)
* **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* **UI Components:** [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (built upon Radix UI and Tailwind CSS)
* **Animations:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
* **Content:** Markdown with Frontmatter (`gray-matter`, `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`)

## Features

* **Modern Stack:** Built with the latest Next.js App Router for efficient routing and rendering.
* **Type Safety:** Written in TypeScript for improved developer experience and code maintainability.
* **Utility-First CSS:** Uses Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
* **Accessible UI Components:** Integrates shadcn/ui for beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable components.
* **Dark Mode:** Theme switching support via `next-themes`.
* **Markdown Content:**
    * Blog posts and news articles are managed as Markdown files (`.md`) within the `content/` directory.
    * Metadata (title, date, excerpt, etc.) is handled via YAML frontmatter.
    * Helper functions in `lib/` (`blogs.ts`, `news.ts`) parse and provide content to the application.
* **Animations:** Simple page/component animations using Framer Motion (defined in `lib/animations.ts`).
* **Optimized Images:** Configured `next/image` for image optimization (see `next.config.ts`).

## Project Structure Highlights

* **`app/`**: Contains all routes, layouts, and pages following the Next.js App Router convention. Global styles are in `app/globals.css`.
* **`components/`**: Houses reusable React components.
* **`components/ui/`**: Specifically contains UI components integrated with or generated by shadcn/ui.
* **`content/`**: Stores markdown files for dynamic content (blogs, news).
* **`lib/`**: Includes utility functions (`utils.ts`), content fetching logic (`blogs.ts`, `news.ts`), and animation definitions (`animations.ts`).
* **`public/`**: Standard Next.js directory for static assets (images, fonts, etc.).
* **Configuration Files**: Standard config files for Next.js (`next.config.ts`), TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`), Tailwind (`tailwind.config.ts`), shadcn/ui (`components.json`), ESLint (`eslint.config.mjs`), etc. are located in the root.
